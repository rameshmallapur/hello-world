# hello-world
My first repository into Github world


Started my step to learning new things about automation and GitHub after a gap of almost 10 years when i was a VB developer and was quite good at some programming but cannot boast of being a complete professional and i repent till today of leaving behind my programming skills without giving a second thought it would have on my career.

But past is past and now have realised which is really a good sign for me atleast and will contiue back into my journey to explore new world of programming with new technologies and hope to excel at it for the sake of my career.

Second Visit to GitHub, without keeping in touch how hard it is to gain back things u learned
